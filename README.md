This is my website! I'm very happy about it. Below are some things from my colophon

## Now playing
The "Now Playing" section my website uses Tasker to sync the position of the song to a server hosted on Nest and grabs the details of the song from last.fm It then grabs time-synced lyrics from lrclib and does some client side math to align them to what I'm currently hearing (±3 seconds).

## Animations

This website uses Barba.js combined with GSAP to animate pages. It's intended to look like an SPA while being made with Eleventy and Vanilla JavaScript. I hate frameworks.

## Map
This uses black and white map tyles from [CARTO](https://carto.com), rendered using MapLibre GL. 

## Icons
Simpleicons with a fallback to the website's favicon.
