# Colophon

A [colophon](https://indieweb.org/colophon) is a section which describes what makes up a site and the design ideology behind it.

The code behind this website is [Open source on GitHub](https://github.com/dispherical/dispherical.com), licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

This website was made to have some fun (e.g. some animations) but also be friendly to a variety of devices and older technology and to save bandwith (many resources are inlined upon compiling).

This website was made using <span id="generator"></span>
{% endrenderTemplate %}

<script>
  document.querySelector("#generator").innerText = "{{ eleventy.generator }}"
</script>
