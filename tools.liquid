# Tools
- [Bionic Reading for epubs](/tools/bionic): This tool turns any EPUB file into a "bionic reading" format, making it more reabable by highlighting the first part of each word to guide your eyes through the text more efficiently.
- [Redblock](/tools/redblock): A list of IPs in CIDR format (newline delimited) which are registered to states which are "harmful to minors".
