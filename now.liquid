# /now
This is my "now" page. [This website basically explains what it is](https://nownownow.com/about). It tells you what I have been doing recently and what I plan on doing in the near future.

## Now
- I am currently working on this website! This is a mostly from scratch building of this website.

## Recently
- I got a 100/100 on my midterms. That was nice.

## Soon
- In the near(ish) future, I'm looking at visiting [Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama)
